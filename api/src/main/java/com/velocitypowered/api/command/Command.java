/**
 * Represents a command that can be executed by a {@link CommandSource}

 * <p><strong>You must not subclass <code>Command</code></strong>. Use one of the following
 * <i>registrable</i> subinterfaces:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link BrigadierCommand}, which supports parameterized arguments and
 * specialized execution, tab complete suggestions and permission-checking logic.
 *
 * <li>{@link SimpleCommand}, modelled after the convention popularized by
 * Bukkit and BungeeCord. Older classes directly implementing {@link Command}
 * are suggested to migrate to this interface.
 *
 * <li>{@link RawCommand}, useful for bolting on external command frameworks
 * to Velocity.
